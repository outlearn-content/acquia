# Overview

We have addressed the initial pieces necessary to build a module so we will move onto the next most common components in Drupal 8: _blocks_ and _forms_.

The [Block API](https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/block_api) in Drupal 8 has been changed such that blocks are now both [plugins](https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/plugins) and entities. Blocks in Drupal 8 consist of two separate API structures: the Block Plugin API, which is a stand-alone reusable API, and the Block Entity API which is a Drupal 8 specific use case of block placement and visibility control. This means that Blocks are now fieldable entities and work with the new Drupal 8 Plugin system ([change record here](https://www.drupal.org/node/1880620)). That means you can create new bundles, add new fields, and view them in different ways.

This change allows developers to use the same block in multiple regions which had been a limitation in versions of Drupal prior to Drupal 8\. In essence, it allows you to create multiple instances of the same block. You are also able to do this when you add a block to a region through the UI and not conflict with another use of the block in another region.

For this lesson we will be using the **block_example** module from the [Examples](http://drupal.org/project/examples) project.

## In this lesson...

*   [Assemble the module - examples/block_example](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/drupal-8-blocks-configuration-and-forms#create).
*   [Learn about the introduction of annotations in Drupal 8](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/drupal-8-blocks-configuration-and-forms#classes).
*   Explore how to add blocks using the Drupal GUI.
*   [Learn about the Form API (or FormsAPI)](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/creating-forms-drupal-8).
*   Explore how to build using the FormsAPI.
*   Explore how to build a block and a page with a form.

We will use the code organization from the [first page](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/building-drupal-8-modules#code) of this chapter.

## Creating a simple block

In the Example project you will find the `block_example` module which contains three code examples for different types of blocks in the `src/Plugin/Block` directory. We will be examining the simplest use case which creates an empty block with nothing in it. The new block is named `ExampleEmptyBlock`, and it will reside in a class file called `ExampleEmptyBlock.php`. The following portion of code is all that is necessary to create an empty block in which you may place anything you wish:

Classes and annotationsAll class files must begin with defining the namespace for the class. After creating the [namespace](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) for the class, we extend the Drupal core `BlockBase` class to create the `ExampleEmptyBlock` class. With that, we can use Drupal PHP Annotations, introduced with Drupal 8.Generic PHP Annotations are self contained comment text which allows the auto-discovery of metadata and registration information regarding a class file. The example above has annotations specifically for **Example: empty block**, located in 2nd set of comment text. By utilizing annotations we notify Drupal that we want to register a new block type (`@Block`) with the id of `example_empty` and the **admin_label** of `Example: empty block`, which is passed through the translation system prior to being used.The `{@inheritdoc}` annotation can be used in a class when you are overriding a class function. This annotation tells the system to use the parent class's annotation.

Note

Drupal will not discover the blocks unless they are properly annotated.

This extends the `BlockBase` class into our `ExampleEmptyBlock`, inside which we implement one method: `build()`. This is one of the most common ad important methods, as it returns a renderable array which the block will print out.Clear the caches, navigate to the layout configuration page **`/admin/structure/block`**, and although in Drupal 7 you would be able to see your new block under the disabled section, in Drupal 8 you have to click **Place Block** to see your new block as a choice:
