# Overview

<!-- @section -->

## Conclusion and summary

In this lesson weâ€™ve begun to explore configurations and the configuration form which can be used to store values in the system. You are encouraged to further explore the `ConfigFormBase` and what options are available for extending it. Additionally, you should try different combinations for importing/exporting configuration between sites using the user interface.

Overall, you should now see how powerful configurations are in Drupal 8 and the amount of improvement to the deployment process that has occurred since Drupal 7.

We've learned about module-level implementation of CM.

*   How to use boiler plate code to reduce the amount of code writing necessary.
*   Configuration management provides a central place for modules to store configuration data rather then implementing a hodgepodge collection of functions (Drupal 7).
*   YAML files are used to implement a common standard for recording configuration data into code.
*   Configuration forms are a specific use form helpful for storing configuration data to the database and file system.
*   A config object is an instantiation of a configuration.

## Step by step instructions:

1.  Switch to the root of your `Examples` directory.
2.  Create a new empty directory called `configform_example`.
3.  Switch to the `configform_example` directory
4.  Create the `configform_example.info.yml` file based on what you learned in Lesson 1.
5.  Cut and paste the sample code into `configform_example.info.yml` file
6.  Create the `configform_example.routing.yml` file.
7.  Cut and paste the sample code into `configform_example.routing.yml` file
8.  Create a new empty directory called `src`.
9.  Switch to the `src` directory
10.  Create a new empty directory called `Form`.
11.  Switch to the `Form` directory
12.  Create the `ConfigFormExampleConfigForm.php` file.
13.  Cut and paste the sample code into the `ConfigFormExampleConfigForm.php` file
14.  Switch back to the `configform_example` directory and create the configform_example.links.menu.yml file.
15.  Cut and paste the sample code into the `configform_example.links.menu.yml` file.
16.  Replace the `FormBase` method with `ConfigFormBase` in the `ConfigFormExampleConfigForm.php` file (start of new material).
17.  Create an empty `config/install` directory.
18.  Create the `configform_example.settings.yml` file in the `config/install` directory.
19.  Modify the `buildForm()` method.
20.  Modify the `getFormId()` method.
21.  Alter the submit handler.
22.  Enable the module.
23.  Rebuild the caches using `drush cr` or `drush8 cr`
24.  To test navigate to `http://mysite.com/examples/configform_example/simple`

You should see a Drupal page with the expected form on it that is configurable.

## Additional questions

To further your understanding, you can explore these additional questions:

*   How did configuration work in Drupal 7?
*   Give three reasons why aggregating configuration functionality into one system is helpful.
*   Modify your sample code to save two values to the configuration system.
*   Read more about multilingual support with the use of schemas.
