# Welcome!

Greetings! Welcome to Part 2 of our learning path series *Building modules with Drupal 8*! In this part we will focus on Entities and Fields. 

* *For Part 1 go to [Building modules with Drupal 8 - Basics](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/pronovix/building-modules-drupal8-part1).*

We built this path using [Acquia's D8 module development training](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/building-drupal-8-modules), and enhanced the learning experience to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

Good luck!
