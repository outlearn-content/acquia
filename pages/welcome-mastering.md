# Welcome!

Greetings! Welcome to Part 3 of our learning path series *Building modules with Drupal 8*! In this part we delve into more advanced topics, like Services, Dependency Injection, Containers, Creating and Theming Elements, Front-end Libraries, Testing and Review. 

* *For Part 2 go to [Building modules with Drupal 8 - Entities and Fields](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/pronovix/building-modules-drupal8-part2).*

We built this path using [Acquia's D8 module development training](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/building-drupal-8-modules), and enhanced the learning experience to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

Good luck!
