# Welcome!

Greetings! Welcome to Part 1 of our learning path series *Building modules with Drupal 8*!

We built this path using [Acquia's D8 module development training](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/building-drupal-8-modules), and enhanced the learning experience to make it more engaging by inserting little tasks and quizzes at appropriate points.

When attempting to determine your skill at programming, it can be difficult to identify which specific issue to identify with. Keep in mind that these lessons are simply an attempt to introduce you to D8 module building. [Lesson 1](https://docs.acquia.com/articles/examples-module-symfony-controllers-and-menu) attempts to teach to the middle, so module creation beginners should refer to the hints and notes for help. Advanced readers should view the hints and notes as optional and focus more on the extra credit. It is perfectly reasonable to gloss over the reading and to attempt to follow the lab goals and actions immediately and use the readings above it solely for reference.

Good luck!
