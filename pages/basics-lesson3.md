#Lesson 3: Configuration Information and Functions

This lesson introduces both a special type of form called a _configuration form_ and Configuration Management (CM), which describes the effort made to gather the multiple sources of configuration information and functions in Drupal 7 into a single system in Drupal 8.

We also take this opportunity to demonstrate how to use boiler plate code. We will guide you through modifying a copy of the `page_example` module which is part of the larger [Examples](http://drupal.org/project/examples) project. We will modify the page_example module so that it uses a configuration form to store a single default value in the configuration system.

## In this lesson...

*   Learn about CM (Configuration Management).
*   Assemble the module `examples/configform_example`.
*   Learn about configuration forms.
*   Explore building a configuration form.
*   Explore creating `*.settings.yml` files as an introduction to using CM to store configurations for a module.
