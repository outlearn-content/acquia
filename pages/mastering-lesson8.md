# Services

## In this lesson...

*   Create the module `examples/service_example` to use a custom service and dependency injection.
*   Learn about services and how they relate to dependency injection.
*   Explore the meaning and uses of Dependency Injection.
*   Explore the meaning and uses of Service Containers
*   Focus on what services mean in programming and why they are useful.
*   Explore creating and registering a simple service.

We are going to create a module that defines a new service `service_example.example_service` and then use that service on a page `examples/service-example/simple` that is controlled by a very simple controller `ServiceExampleController`.
